Sample SecureSocial 2 Application (Scala version)
=================================================
To run this sample you need to:

1) Copy the contents of the module-core into the modules/securesocial.  If you are using a unix based
OS you can do a symbolic link instead.

2) Create an application in the developer site of each provider you want to try and configure the OAuth 
settings in the application.conf file.
