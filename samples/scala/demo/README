Sample SecureSocial 2 Application (Scala version)
=================================================
To run this sample you need to:

1) Copy the contents of the module-code directory into modules/securesocial.  If you are using a unix based
OS you can do a symbolic link instead.

2) Create an application in the developer site of each provider you want to try and configure the OAuth 
settings in the securesocial.conf file.  

3) Include securesocial.conf from application.conf
